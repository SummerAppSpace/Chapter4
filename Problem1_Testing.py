#!/usr/bin/env python
# PART 1:
# Run the code, save the file, exit, then execute from the bash console:
# python3.5 Problem1_Testing.py
# You WILL get a crash. We will fix this as an exercise in PART 3.

# PART 2:
# Wrap the entire code after the imports in a try/except block. 
# The exception should print the error and then on a new line "still working on it"

# PART 3: 
# There is something wrong with the astroML package that is causing it to crash! We will fix this error and then try again
# A) Go to the directory astroML in which the git respository is located for the code. Go to the subdirectory datasets
# open the file sdss_specgals.py and edit the DATA_URL tuple to be correct
# B) Reinstall astroML by executing on the bash console:
# python3.5 setup.py install --user
# C) Execute this file again. Look at the image that the code prints out.

# PART 4:
# A) Put all the code after the imports in a function that takes a single argument, the projection
# B) Add documentation to your function indicating what values of the projection are allowed. Options are:
# 'hammer', 'aitoff', 'mollweide', 'lambert'
# C) Call your new function with each projection one at a time, verify it is working
# D) Change your function to change the name of the figure depending on the projection, so that when you
# call it 4 times you get 4 figures
# E) Add an assertion to check to make sure that the projection is one of the options
# F) Call your function with the argument "sillyprojection" and verify your assertion cause the code to crash

# The following code works with the SDSS Survey

#   The figure is an example from astroML: see http://astroML.github.com
